The party starts in Zadash. It’s the afternoon, and we find a notice in a paper that says we could meet a captain named Olivia, who’s looking for people to help out with some problems in exchange for a bit of coin. 

We quickly meet everyone, and it is here for the first time when Stuffy reveals his enemy, Bubbles, and asks us if we have met the pink/red dinosaur with angry eyes.

After that, a guard asks us to come in where we meet Captain Olivia, who is fighting and showing people how cool she is. She explains the three jobs we could take.

The Goblins who are attacking miners in the east of Zadash, in the Herathis Mines, and causing a lot of issues for workers and population alike. Payment: 60 gold.

A group of wolves named the White Fang who is attacking farmers and causing a lot of problems in the area. Payment: 90 gold.
And finally, a group of adventurers who are stealing from miners and causing a lot of problems in the area of Felderwin and Alfied. Payment: 120 gold.

Captain is worried, so she asks us to make sure we are strong enough to deal with it, and for that and the fact we don’t really know how we work well together, we decide to take on the goblins, since it seems like the best option. The Captain tells us that if we manage to do one or two of these missions safely, a mission involving a ransacked warehouse and some disappearances might be on our plates.

After a few good or bad rolls of recall knowledge, we decide to go straight ahead towards the camp, deciding to sleep on our way there. It ends up backfiring slightly when a group of Goblins attacks us during the night. Luckily, the group was small and weak, and we manage to kill all but one (Grognag). He tells there are 40 (4x10) goblins in the camp, that they usually send traveling groups of 10 and that they have at least 7 magic users. 

We have our new goblin friend accompany us to their dens in exchange for his freedom (which we grant him as promised). The battle that goes afterwards goes a bit… It could have been better, but also worse. After hard work, Pallad going down, and a lot of smashing with swords, arrows, eidolons and magic we manage to survive. In the end, we kill all the “dogs” and goblins that were in the entry.
