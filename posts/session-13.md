We start the session receiving some letters and packages fans or members of the public has sent us, alongside some packages. We all get letters, and some packages. 

- Fenic gets called a clown and gets a clown nose. 
- Stuffy gets a staff, but he refuses to accepts is for him since he is sent from The Collector and is for a "poppet" and obviously Stuffy isn't a poppet. (Maybe we need to have the conversation soon). 
- Eli gets some cool looking goggles and a letter by a "crazy man". But the goggles look useful!
- Carmilla gets a letter by Renda, the cute gnome girl she talked to in the bar (but it means nothing!).
- Salem gets a less kind letter by a certain Hunter D. who claims that is hard to hunt them down and ask the twins to drink the two healing potions inside.
- Chaka gets a letter by a fellow leshy named Pixie that wants to build bridges with her old friend Miffi, and gives him two strawberries.

The twins worry about the letter, so for the sake of honesty and safety, they admit to the group they are dhampirs and explain that there are hunters who don't love that for them. The group reacts well, and legends tell Stuffy is still asking questions to this day.

Here, Wendig gives us secret information on what is going on. He tells us that the next things we'll probably have to fight in a weeks time is some water creatures and a dragon. A smaller, wingless one! And we'd still be screwed so it's jailbreak time!

Chaka goes to talk to Miffi to tell her about the letter. She doesn't want to know anything about Pixie, since she blames her for putting her in this position. We learn Miffi is helping Dazzlegrays with herb stuff. She believes they get the plants from a very distant place with the help of a teleportation circle. That is good to know! Chaka gives her the strawberries and she gives him a normal non magical object 4 leaf clover.

Carmilla goes to talk to Erdell. She apologizes for putting her in harms way and Erdell doesn't blame her. Luckily the drow can see the ghosts so when there is none, Carmilla tells her about their escape plan. She is in, and will help. A big demon tells her it's time to go, and Carmilla, like the coward she is, complies.

Stuffy goes to give the letter and the wand to the poppets since it must be a mistake! (We really, really need to have the talk.) The poppets are grateful for Stuffy's... honesty? and they gift him a striking rune. 

Fenic uses his fox form to get in the jail, and the grumpy one reacts in a bit of a... asshole way? But the rest listen to the kitsune. He explains that the next foe is a dragon, and just like Stuffy, they don't seem to be taking it seriously. Nevertheless, Fenic convinces them to join the escape plan when the time is right. 

We decide we should look for the teleportation circle. And we go to sleep. Now there is 5 days till Fenic is healed, and 6 till we fight a dragon. 

The next day, after some good (hopefully) recall knowledge by Chaka, we decide the ghosts aren't as much of a problem for our sleuthing as Wendig is. Good thing Carmilla can distract him ~~(help)~~.

Carmilla asks him to have some good Christian time alone, and they leave for his room where they talk and talk as Carmilla distracts him. The rest of the gang goes to investigate the room behind him. They fail at opening the door stealthily, although Eli gets a clutch nat20 at understanding the levers. They will open the doors for our fellow captives.

But first, they have to fight some animated armors. Luckily, and with the help of some good crits by Salem, they manage to get rid of them swiftly and quickly. They do make a mess.  They recognize the levers that open and close the arena and cell doors. But they don't recognize the other three. One of them seems magical, with some blue and purple liquid. The other one seems more normal. Salem pulls all the levers. Nothing seems to happen.

In another area, they see a bunch of boxes with flowers. They believe it's probably what made us fall asleep and that they come from Xhorhas, which would fit with the teleportation circle idea. They find more flowers that seem to come from Xhorhas. In room, they find more skeletons like the ones we fought the other day, and they decide to leave that from maybe later to avoid death. We don't like the undead!

After that, they decide to investigate the levers a bit more, and Carmilla manages to keep entertaining Wendig for a bit longer. They have, for now, 20 more minutes. What will our disasters break next?
