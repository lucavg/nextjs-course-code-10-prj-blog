We start with the somber funeral of our fallen comrade Pallad. In a church for the Raven Queen, a priest officiates the ceremony as we all get a chance to say goodbye. 

Carmilla sings a song, Salem says some nice words and gives him a red stone. Fenic gives him money as a nice goodbye gesture and says something emotional, and Eli gives him a meteor-hammer pendant. Stuffy destroys us cause he still doesn't fully get he is dead, dead.

A woman from the Golden Chain guild says also some words, and she makes sure he will get to his parents. The priest burns his body and we say goodbye to him, emotionally.

After that we do a small time skip, and Carmilla and Eli meet Chaka, a little leshy, and his trusted best friend Nut. He was being harassed after wanting to take some flowers, not knowing money is a thing.

Carmilla pays for the flowers, and seeing he might be a great healer and a good addition to the party, they invite him to join.

Sadly, Chaka's first introduction to the party is with a massive fight, as Salem reveals a newly made scar and how the white mask knows about his involvement with the lavish hotel. He has also cursed his bastard sword, which Stuffy burns as it is cursed and dangerous.

Things escalate even further as Fenic reveals he has been payed to help kill Erdell, something Carmilla doesn't take very well. They have a massive fight, and they decide not to help the empire kill her. Carmilla reveals she talked to Erdell, and how she now knows Feshenar is one of the people who killed her father, and how she is beginning to think he might be involved with the Fallendagger and the Emberarrow. She also reveals Emberarrow killed Daniella.

With all of that, they, again, decide to warn Erdell. To avoid putting eyes on them, Carmilla disguises herself as an older woman she calls Gina, and dresses herself up to avoid suspicion. Thank you Fenic's hat. Then, she gives Erdell a note she reads and burns, seemingly listening to Carmilla. 

After that, they leave for Hupperdook to find the evil, vile, horrible Bubbles. Or to escape from there for safety. In the way, the party gets too curious about Chaka and there's a bit of conflict, nothing new. Thankfully, Salem got a very cool, very big and very rare clockwork wagon and it helps the party leave faster towards Hupperdook. And especially, thank good Eli knows how to drive.

On the way to Hupperdook they find a couple of elves who tell the twins about the dangers cursing Berleben. There, children are going missing because of the Witch of the Marches. The couple is leaving for the Plumgroves. The twins decide they can't do much and continue their way. 

Finally, we find a couple of log workers bandits. Fenic and Salem try to scare them, but they fail. This causes a fight with big kaiju Stuffy going down. Thankfully, he was brought back up, and with a bit of teamwork, all the bandits deal with. Hopefully our next log workers are nicer
